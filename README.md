# SCP-198
EXILED plugin for SCP:SL that has a chance of possessing a picked up item with SCP-198. Full features are below.
- Each time a player picks up an item, there is a small chance (default 0.1%) of that item getting possessed with SCP-198. (Excludes ammo and armor)
- When an item gets possessed, the player who picked it up will not be able to remove it from their inventory unless they die.
- If the possessed item is a consumable or throwable, that item cannot be used.
- Only a single item can be possessed each round. Possessed items will keep their status for the remainder of the round, even if they are dropped when a player dies.
- Attempting to upgrade a possessed item in SCP-914 while in a players hand has a chance (default 50%) of killing them. Only works if the '914-mode' setting in the server config is set to 'Held' or 'DroppedAndHeld'.

# Notes:
- See your EXILED config for options to enable/disable specific gamemodes. (Make sure you run the server at least once with the plugin so the configs generate.)
