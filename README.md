# SCP-198
EXILED plugin for SCP:SL that has a chance of possessing a picked up item with SCP-198. Full features are below.
- Each time a player picks up an item, there is a 5% chance of that item getting possessed with SCP-198. (Excludes grenades and ammo.)
- When an item gets possessed, all items of that type are possessed as well.
- Only one type of item will be possessed each round.
- All players on the server will be notified when an item becomes possessed.
- Players who pick up a possessed item will be notified about it.
- If the possessed item is a medical item, gun, grenade, or keycard, attempting to use it will result in death.
- Attempting to upgrade a possessed item in SCP-914 while in a players hand will result in death. Works best with [KadeDev's Common-Utils plugin.](https://github.com/KadeDev/Common-Utils)

# Notes:
- See your EXILED config for options to enable/disable specific gamemodes. (Make sure you run the server at least once with the plugin so the configs generate.)
