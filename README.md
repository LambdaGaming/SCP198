# SCP-198
EXILED plugin for SCP:SL that has a chance of possessing a picked up item with SCP-198. Full features are below.
- Each time a player picks up an item, there is a chance (default 5%) of that item getting possessed with SCP-198. (Excludes ammo)
- When an item gets possessed, all items of that type are possessed as well.
- Only one type of item will be possessed each round, and only one player will be affected by it each round.
- If the possessed item is a medical item, gun, grenade, or keycard, attempting to use it will result in death. (Can be configured)
- Attempting to upgrade a possessed item in SCP-914 while in a players hand has a chance (default 50%) of killing them. Works best if the '914-mode' config is set to 'Held' or 'DroppedAndHeld'.

# Notes:
- See your EXILED config for options to enable/disable specific gamemodes. (Make sure you run the server at least once with the plugin so the configs generate.)
